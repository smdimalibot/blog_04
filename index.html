    <br /><p>This article explores the how social media (negatively) effect on the mental health of teens in America. According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the article, it states that 90% of teens aged 13-17 have used social media, and teens are online on average nine hours a day, not including time spent on homework. It shows that social media can be both addictive and time consuming, allowing no room for productive activities (i.e., homework, chores, etc...) To make matters worse is that addictive social media is on the rise rather than falling down, due to trendy social media such as TikTok. Therefore, social media addiction in America (and in general) is more problematic than anything, especially the teens as its target-demographic.</p>

            <br /><p>This article answers the question "how green are electric vehicles?" As the article answers, electric vehicles are green, but not perfectly green. Although they obviously do not emit carbon footprint like the everyday gasoline car, they do have batteries that obviously emit toxic fumes. Another flaw to point out is that the electric vehicles are also made from non-renewable energy, which is defiently not environmentally-friendly. Although the surface does show that electric vehicles are more eco-friendly than traditional gasoline cars, the turth is, it has a dark side on where many people are not aware of.</p>
