            <br /><p>This article explores the how social media (negatively) effect on the mental health of teens in America. According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the article, it states that 90% of teens aged 13-17 have used social media, and teens are online on average nine hours a day, not including time spent on homework. It shows that social media can be both addictive and time consuming, allowing no room for productive activities (i.e., homework, chores, etc...) To make matters worse is that addictive social media is on the rise rather than falling down, due to trendy social media such as TikTok. Therefore, social media addiction in America (and in general) is more problematic than anything, especially the teens as its target-demographic.</p>
